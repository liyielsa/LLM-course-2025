# Evaluating LLMs

Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NB7AxwV8mIaJbh9a93yPPCN2PFskLdZ_we0psqrCIJc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Lab Assignment

1. Pick a language that you know well (is not English) 
2. Pick an LLM readily accessible to you (which can handle the language you picked above)
3. Take the 14 questions (below) and run them in localised and general variants
* You need to pick some locales you want to test!
4. Record the responses and inspect them. 
* Is there a difference between responses in two languages? In how many questions?
* Is there less difference if the questions are localised? In how many questions?
* Were there some entertaining responses or differences worth noting?
5. You may do this in pairs or groups! One language per person, though!

For (1) above use: "We live in COUNTRY and want to eat like the locals."
